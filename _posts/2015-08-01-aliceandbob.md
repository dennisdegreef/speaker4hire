# Description
HTTPS, SSL, SSH, PGP are terms most people know that they are somehow related to encryption. But how does it work? 
During this talk you will find out why even the most complex encryption algorithms used today are based on very simple 
concepts. We will dive into the basics of public key encryption, how it works and together with some (simple) examples, 
give you some insight on encryption in general.

And who the heck are Alice and Bob anyway?
