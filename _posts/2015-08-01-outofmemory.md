# Description
One of the hardest question to ask on a linux platform: how much memory does my application use. This is mostly 
because Linux is amazingly efficient when it comes to memory usage and management. But it comes with a price: 
readability on how much memory your application really uses.

During this advanced presentation, we will talk about virtual spaces, MMUs, mmap(), shared, resident and virtual 
memory and how it all fits together on your servers.

Afterwards, you will be one of few who can read tools like "top" and "free" and really understand what's going on.



# More information
This is a highly advanced subject, however it will be understandable by everybody who at least knows a bit about linux. 

It mostly will dive into how Linux manages its memory, and how a process (multiple processes actually) can share 
memory, and how ultimately, you be able to read tools like "top" and "free" much  better
