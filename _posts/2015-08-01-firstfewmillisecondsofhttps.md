# Description
What happens when your browser connects to a HTTPS secure site? We all know it has to do something with 
certificates, blue and green address bars and sometimes your browser will give warnings which we normally 
click away.

But what actually happens under the hood? In this talk I will give a step-by-step explanation on the first 
few hundred milliseconds during a connection to HTTPS. We will talk about master secrets, shared secrets, 
cipher suites, x509 certificates and why secure does not (always) mean secure.
