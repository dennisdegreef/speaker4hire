# Biography
Joshua Thijssen is a freelance consultant and trainer. His daily work consists of maintaining code bases, working on 
different projects and helping other to achieve higher standards in both coding and thinking. He is author of the 
PHP|Architect book "[Mastering the SPL library](http://www.phparch.com/books/mastering-the-spl-library/)" and the 
[Symfony Rainbow Series](http://symfony-rainbow.com/), founder of the Dutch Web Alliance and regular speaker at 
national and international conferences.

# Talk history
Joshua Thijssen is a regular speaker in both the national and international circuit. His talks are usually 
"everything-but-php", and he likes to dive into the things we take for granted on a daily basis. As a conference 
speaker, he has traveled around the world (and back) to many of the great (PHP) conferences available, but especially 
enjoys the local usergroup meetups and small audiences for more Q&amp;A and improvisation.
