# Description
Did you know you can write a webserver in AWK and that SED supports conditional jumps? Probably not... These tools 
(and languages) are much more powerful than most people know. The SED &amp; AWK combination gives you massive power 
IF used correctly. Although most people use it for simple tasks like search/replacing or sort certain 
columns of a file, the potential is much higher. During this talk we go about the common uses, the not-so-common 
uses of both sed and awk. Learn how to do much more stuff much faster.
