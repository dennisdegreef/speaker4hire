# Description
Nothing is showing up in the logs, everythings works fine on your development and acceptance environment, your unit-tests are all green and yet you've got major issues on your production server. What to do? Restart apache? Reboot the system? Maybe we even add more machines? Hell no! We debug it Chuck Norris style! I will show you how you can use advanced (linux) tools like strace, iostat, gdb and even dtrace to figure out the bottlenecks in your system. Is it even your code that is buggy or can we easily identify other things that can go wrong?
