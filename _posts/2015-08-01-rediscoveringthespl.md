# Description
The Standard PHP Library (SPL) might be one of the most powerful, yet the most unused part of PHP, but you are one of 
those lucky developers who have discovered it! But now what? The lack of documentation about SPL makes it that a lot 
users don't really harvest the power that SPL brings. During this presentation I will dive into the numerous iterators, 
data-structures and interfaces that SPL defines and when & how to implement them in your own projects, but we will talk 
about the edge-cases as well, as in SPL land things don't always are what they seem..
